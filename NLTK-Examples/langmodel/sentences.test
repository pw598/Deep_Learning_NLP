In biology, immunity is the state of having sufficient biological defences to avoid infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion.
Naturally acquired immunity occurs through contact with a disease causing agent, when the contact was not deliberate, whereas artificially acquired immunity develops only through deliberate actions such as vaccination.
Immunity from prosecution occurs when a prosecutor grants immunity, usually to a witness in exchange for testimony or production of other evidence. 
Transactional immunity (colloquially known as "blanket" or "total" immunity) completely protects the witness from future prosecution for crimes related to his or her testimony.
Hearing loss is being partly or totally unable to hear sound in one or both ears.
Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear.
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. 
This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed.
In law, a hearing is a proceeding before a court or other decision-making body or officer, such as a government agency.
Within some criminal justice systems, a preliminary hearing (evidentiary hearing) is a proceeding, after a criminal complaint has been filed by the prosecutor, to determine whether there is enough evidence to require a trial.
