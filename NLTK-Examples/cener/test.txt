The wait for a decent LG phone on Verizon is finally over with the Spectrum 2.

Not only does it run the new(ish) Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system, it also has a screen that doesn't require two hands and a stylus. In addition, it's priced right at the $100 mark, making it one of the more affordable Big Red handsets.

With its noticeably sectioned back plate and defined edges, the LG Spectrum 2's design looks more thought-out and deliberate than is usual for LG's latest run of devices, save for the high-end Nexus 4 and Optimus G.

It measures 5.31 inches tall and 2.69 inches wide. At 0.36 inch thick and 5.16 ounces, it's thicker and a bit heavier than most LG handsets I've run into, and it's a tight fit in a small jeans pocket, but it's comfortable when held in the hand or pinned between the cheek and shoulder. 

On the left there are a Micro-USB port and two separate buttons for adjusting the volume. Up top are a 3.5mm headphone jack and a circular sleep/power button, the edges of which light up blue whenever it's pressed. 

The rear of the phone houses an 8-megapixel camera with an LED flash.  Though plastic, the black plate is coated with a textured, rubberlike material that feels almost like leather. The cover has two small slits at the bottom for the audio speaker. Removing the plate gives access to the 2,150mAh battery, a microSD card slot, and Verizon's 4G LTE SIM card. Directly on the other side of the cover are the NFC antenna and wireless charging coil.

The 4.7-inch True HD IPS screen is bright and vivid, and texts and icons rendered crisply and clearly. It has the same screen as the unlocked LG Optimus 4X HD, with the same 1,280x720-pixel resolution. Overall, the display is vivid and bright, not to mention responsive to the touch. At the time of the 4X HD review, I was very impressed with the screen. 

However, having now spent time with higher-tier LG devices such as the Nexus 4 and the Optimus G, I noticed that upon closer inspection, the Spectrum 2's display isn't as crystal-clear as the two others. Default wallpapers looked a tad noisy, and gradient patterns appeared streaky, but only by a small margin. Above the screen is a 1.3-megapixel camera and below are four hot keys (back, home, recent apps, and menu) that illuminate in blue when in use.
